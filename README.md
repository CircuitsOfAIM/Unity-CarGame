# Unity-CarGame

![](./gamescr.png)

This is a simple car game implementation on Unity software.
Due to huge data size on `Library` subdirectory it is zipped on the corresponding directory.In order to test, firstly unzip this directory.
This is not a standard approach as usually these files are tracked using `GIT LFS`.But for ease of use I just zipped them.

### Game Play
